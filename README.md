# Endorse
Stochastic prediction of a safety indicator of excavation damage zone for a deep geological repository
based on simulation of contaminant transport and using Bayes inversion for identification of the key transport parameters. 

# Transition plan 
for transition from [Geomop/Endorse-legacy](github.com/Geomop/Endorse-legacy) forked from [jbrezmorf/Endorse](github.com/jbrezmorf/Endorse)
The reason for the transition is get rid of large files and deprecated experiments in early stages of the project.

1. merge all branches to master in Geomop/Endorse-legacy
2. add state of master in Geomop/Endorse-legacy in single commit
3. move all issues from jbrezmorf/Endorse to Geomop/endorse [solution](https://jloh.co/posts/bulk-migrate-issues-github-cli/)
4. possible further changes in Enorse-legacy would be made through the branches in the new repositoy and appropriate pull request
