## fitting
**Processing observed pressure data from multipacker.** 
1. convert to solumnd per chamber
2. introduce common simulation time
3. add chamber info
4. pressure jump detection
5. TODO: filtering
5. synchronise to blast timesdetect
6. 2D table, single measurement per row
7. plotting

**Fitting water pressure tests**
