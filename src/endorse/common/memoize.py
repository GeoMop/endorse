"""
Caching of pure function calls currently based on the joblib.
- File wrapper class allows safe file results with appropriate hashes.

TODO: 
- support for other storage methods
- hashing of function implementation and subcalls 
  (working prototype in endorse-experiment, but does not generilize to more complex programs)
 see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18134087/how-do-i-check-if-a-python-function-changed-in-live-code
 that one should aslo hash called function .. the whole tree
 more over we should also hash over serialization of classes

- program execution view in browser (? how related to Ray, Dask, ..)

class File:
    """
    An object that should represent a file as a computation result.
    Use cases:
    - pass File(file_path) to a memoize function that reads from a file
    - return File(file_path) from a memoize function that writes to a file

    Contains the path and the file content hash.
    The system should also prevent modification of the files that are already created.
    To this end one has to use File.open instead of the standard open().
    Current usage:

    with File.open(path, "w") as f:
        f.write...

    return File.from_handle(f)  # check that handel was opened by File.open and is closed, performs hash.

    Ideally, the File class could operate as the file handle and context manager.
    However that means calling system open() and then modify its __exit__ method.
    However I was unable to do that. Seems like __exit__ is changed, but changed to the original
    one smowere latter as
    it is not called. Other possibility is to wrap standard file handle and use it like:

    @joblib.task
     def make_file(file_path, content):`
        with File.open(file_path, mode="w") as f: # calls self.handle = open(file_path, mode)
